# Morisset Pathfindr

This project was created at the request of the librarians at the Morisset Library at the University of Ottawa
to enable better navigation of the library for all patrons, especially those with visual or auditory impairments.
Therefore, it is necessary for people who may not be able to read the screen at all to use the product and
interact with the environment safely. After meeting with the clients to discuss their needs, the 5-member project team designed
a product that involves physical Bluetooth beacons which will be placed at points of interest and this phone app
that allows users to communicate with these beacons in order to reach their destination.
